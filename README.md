## Image Detection using CNN
Dataset: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html <br>
About Dataset: The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. <br>
In this notebook above dataset is trained using two methods<br>
1. By Artificial Neural Network
2. By Convolutional Neural Network <br>

#### What I found? 
Accuracy of ANN on test data is 52.62% whereas it also took much time to train.<br>
On the other hand the accuracy of CNN for the same test data and same number of epochs is 67.52% and it also took very less time to train as compared to ANN.

#### Conclusion:
CNN performs better than ANN in Image Detection.
